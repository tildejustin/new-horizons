## New Horizons
A standalone mod that intercepts the `LevelStorage$Session::checkValid` call in `LevelStorage$Session::getIconFile`, which is known to cause crashes with WorldPreview, State-Output, and FastReset.

## Culture Me Up
The mod [Voyager](https://github.com/tildejustin/voyager) fixes a multithreaded bug much alike to New Horizons. There was also a [Voyager 2](https://github.com/modmuss50/Voyager-2), which was never legalized for MCSR. These are also the names of the two first sucessful intersteller space probes, and the only other active intersteller space probe is [New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons), which is where the name came from.
